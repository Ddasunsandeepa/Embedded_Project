# Smart Agriculture System with ESP32, MQTT, and Node.js

## Overview

This project demonstrates a **smart agriculture system** using an ESP32 microcontroller to monitor plant conditions (temperature, humidity, and soil moisture) and control a water pump. The system sends sensor data to a **Node.js backend** via **MQTT**, stores it in **MongoDB**, and allows real-time monitoring and pump control using **Blynk**.

**Key Features:**

- Read temperature, humidity, and soil moisture from sensors.
- Auto control of water pump based on soil moisture.
- Real-time data publishing via MQTT to Node.js backend.
- Store sensor data in MongoDB for historical analysis.
- Optional dashboard with Blynk virtual pins for remote monitoring and control.
